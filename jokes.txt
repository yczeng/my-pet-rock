Shake me like an earthquake!
Please don't take my feelings for granite.
I lava you.
Can you make my bedrock?
Igneous is bliss.
I'm a 10 on the Moh's scale of hardness for you!
You make me hard like a diamond.
Of quartz I'll marry you!
Can you ruby my back?
Are you sedimentary? Cuz I want a piece of you.
Without you, my life is in obsidian.
I marble over how smooth you are.
We are more than plutonic.
You are a basalt to my emotions.
You don't have to be as flat as a plateau!
Let's get boulder.
You crack me up like a fault line.
That is a nice cleavage you have.
You make me rock hard.
You are marblelous!
You have a heart of coal.
Take everything with a grain of sand.
Nice astroid!
We are like two tectonic plates; there is too much friction.
Is my subduction working?
You magmafy my heart!
My heart erupted like a volcano for you.
There's a lot of pressure underneath, if you know what I mean.
You aluminum my life!
Your Grand Tetons make me rocky.
Are you a mountain? 'Cuz I want to hump you.
What a gem you are!
Under your pressure I metamorphosize.
You are purpurate for me.
Are you a rare earth metal? Because mining you has polluted my heart.
Please don't be a pyrite!
You poison my mind like arsenic.
Thanks to you, my volcano just erupted!
Let the lava flow!
Are we in an aquifer? Because it's getting wet down here!
Feel free to gravel whatever you want.
Are you Mars? Because you're wet!
Can you repair my crack with your cement?
Stop! Too much erosion!
Let's go down the valley.
Show me your grand canyon!
You make me squirt like a geyser!
You ore mine!
Can I get your chemical formula?
Let's iron it out.
You shale be mine.
Are you Magnetite? 'Cuz you're attractive.
You're a geo, and I want to crack you open.
Are you a supercontinent? 'Cuz you have a large landmass.
How long will it be until our landmasses touch?
Please don't breccia up with me!
Wanna grind me down?
You're a rockstar!
I have a quarry. Will you marry me?
My heart is a collapsed mine.
You're mine.
Don't be silicon!
Are you copper? 'Cuz you electrify me.
You're mine, until the rock cycle do us part.
I've loved you since the stone age.
Let's take off our garnets.
Are you a rock collector? 'Cuz I wanna be in your binder.
Can you blast my rock with dynamite?
Are you a meteorite? You really left an impact on me.
